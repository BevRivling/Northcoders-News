# Northcoders News - Front End

A portfolio piece from my work at Northcoders to make a news-style site in which users can sign in, post articles, leave comments, vote for their favourites, and sort through them.


### Viewing

You can either explore the app hosted online at https://festive-aryabhata-221d0b.netlify.com/.  You must first sign in with a username of 'happyamy2016', 'cooljmessy', or 'weegembump'.  You can then type any string as a password.  Then click on the 'N' in the top left corner to begin and choose your topic.

Alternatively, you can clone the repo, run `npm i` followed by `npm start` in order to run the app in development mode.  The page will reload if you make edits.


#### Built With
